ABC Private Limited Retail Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction

ABC Private Limited, a retail company, aims to understand customer purchase behavior, particularly purchase amounts, for various products across different categories. They have provided a purchase summary of selected high-volume products from the previous month. The dataset includes customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city type, stay in current city), product details (product ID and category), and total purchase amount.
Problem Statement

ABC Private Limited seeks to develop a predictive model to forecast the purchase amount of customers for various products. This model will enable them to create personalized offers tailored to individual customers for different products. The objective is to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement by providing targeted promotions based on predicted purchase behavior.
Dataset Description

The dataset provided by ABC Private Limited comprises the following information:

    Customer Demographics:
        Age
        Gender
        Marital status
        City type
        Duration of stay in the current city

    Product Details:
        Product ID
        Product category

    Purchase Summary:
        Total purchase amount from the previous month

Project Goals

    Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and distributions of the provided data. This involves visualizing demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts.

    Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training. This may include encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.

    Model Development: Build and train machine learning models to predict customer purchase amounts based on demographics and product details. Evaluate the performance of different models and select the most suitable one based on evaluation metrics such as RMSE or MAE.

    Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to predict purchase amounts for new customer-product combinations. Integrate the model into ABC Private Limited's systems to enable real-time predictions and personalized offer generation.

    Performance Monitoring and Iteration: Continuously monitor the model's performance and gather feedback from its deployment. Iterate on the model as necessary to improve its accuracy and relevance in predicting customer purchase behavior.
